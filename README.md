# Gazette Liquor Licensees

This first draft of this script was banged together out of curiosity at a Codebridge community evening. In its current state, it should be considered a very rough skeleton to be built upon or abandoned.
 
The purpose of the exercise was to determine whether a data processing pipeline can be established to extract liquor licensees from the gazettes. 
 
## Converting before processing

In its present state, the script assumes that the PDF files have been converted to text using Adobe Acrobat XI. Different converters generate different output, so a text file generated by a different converter will break the script. 
 
 Several conversion options exist:
  
 * In theory, PDF files could be converted in batch using the API from [Solid Documents](http://www.soliddocuments.com/), who provide the conversion within Acrobat. However, this is a .NET API.
 * To keep the same format, another pathway would be to use a batch conversion action within Acrobat XI.
 * Finally, another converter can be used, in which case the regular expressions will need to be rewritten.
 
## Regular expressions module: regex vs. re

 The script uses the [`regex` module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex) in preference to `re` because the standard `re` is sub-standard in comparison to regular expression engines available in other major languages. C via PCRE, .NET languages, Java, Ruby and Perl all have robust regular expression flavors.
 
 In turn, the `regex` module is one of the best-rounded regular expression engines around.
